# Covid_music_flights

This project visualizes Spotify Streams count for Genres Vs Flight Passenger Count during Covid years.

We attempted to create a flask api to design an interactive interface for the user. However we couldn't get the chart to display the data we wanted. I think we had a lot of trouble referencing the data.
We attempted to use chart js as the js not taught in class but again, we had trouble getting the data to display.

# Interactive Dashboard
For our interactive dashboard, we built it from the program/module called streamlit. You are required to install streamlit to run the app.py to see the dashboard.
We used python and plotly to design the dashboard and interact with the information.

Chart.js is used to display the data on each page. Python Flask is used to show each page and it's graph.

To run:
`cd flaskapp/application`
`npm install`
